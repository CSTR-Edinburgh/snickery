## per coefficient) and stored to disk.

# standardise_join_data = True 
                 
## The "synth" script loads the standardised data and applies the following weights. 
## These weights are applied to the data before distances are computed, which is 
## equivalent to weighting the differences before squaring, but slightly more efficient
## and allows us to use KD tree implementations with only simple Euclidean distance.
## The weights used here would be squared if they were to be applied to the squared 
## difference term (as in the more standard formulation of weighted Euclidean distance)
## with the same effect.
