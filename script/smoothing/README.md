# LibWavGen

Library for waveform concatenation and smoothing of joins for unit selection based TTS.

@ Author: [Felipe Espic](http://felipeespic.com)

This library is based in an old version of the [MagPhase Vocoder](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/magphase) with modifications done by Cassia Valentini-Botinhao.


## Internal notes
### Cassia VB (14/11/17):
  * I made small changes to libwavgen.py that are noted with CVB. 

### TODO:
  * Comment the code.
  * Clean from unnecessary comments and functions.
